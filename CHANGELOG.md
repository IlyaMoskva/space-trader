## [0.3.0] — Alien Invasion

### Alien Invasion System
- **`constants/aliens.js`** — 3 ship types (Scout/Cruiser/Dreadnought), occupation stages, gadget/weapon constants
- **`engine/aliens.js`** — full invasion engine: `generateAlienEncounter`, `tickAlienInvasion`, `onAlienKilled`, `checkAlienInvasionStart`, `getOccupationStatus`, `getOccupiedServices`, `doAlienCombatRound`
- **test-aliens.cjs** — 22 alien engine tests

### Alien Ship Types
| Ship | Hull | Weapons | Plasma | Regen | Flee |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scout | 80 | 1× pulse | — | 3/round | Hard (fast) |
| Cruiser | 180 | 2× pulse | 60 dmg, 25% | 5/round | Easy |
| Dreadnought | 350 | 3× pulse | 100 dmg, 20% | 8/round | Easy (slow) |

### Occupation Progression
- `scouted` — 1–4 aliens, market works, warnings in news
- Tiny/Small: anarchy immediately at 5 aliens
- Medium/Large: dictatorship phase → anarchy at 30 days
- Huge/Gargantuan: dictatorship → anarchy at 60 days
- **Dictatorship**: no market, repair OK, shields OK (tech ≥ 2)
- **Anarchy**: no market, repair OK, NO shields
- War on planet lifts service restrictions

### Invasion Mechanics
- Starts when `alien_invasion` quest fails or deadline passes
- Seeds 1–2 systems near quest target
- **Tick every 3 days**: NPC defense roll (police+tech), spread at 5/5 aliens
- **Game over** if 30+ systems occupied
- NPC defense: `police × 15% + tech × 5%` chance to reduce alien count
- **Spread**: 5 aliens → attack nearest uninfected neighbour within 200 coords

### Combat
- Alien encounters in invaded systems + 15% chance in neighbouring systems
- **Hull regeneration** each round (3–8 hp) — blocked by Regen Inhibitor gadget
- **Plasma burst** bypasses shields entirely
- **Alien Disruptor** weapon: 25 dmg × 2 vs aliens = 50 effective (available tech 7+)
- **Regen Inhibitor** gadget: blocks regen (requires 10 artifacts, tech 8+)
- **Cloaking Device** gadget: +40% flee chance vs aliens (requires 5 artifacts, tech 7+)
- Killing alien: rep +1, artifact drop (40–80% chance), reduces system alien count
- **Alien game over screen** if galaxy falls

### Galaxy Map
- Invaded systems shown in orange/red dots
- Alien icons beside system name: `👾👾👾` (1 per alien, max 5)
- 5/5 systems show red dot colour

### Alien Artifacts
- Drop on alien kill (type-dependent chance)
- Sell anywhere not occupied: 3,000 cr each
- Accumulate total for gadget unlock (5 → Cloaking, 10 → Regen Inhibitor)
- TradeScreen shows artifact section when in hold

### Service Worker
- Manual `public/sw.js` replaces vite-plugin-pwa (better iOS support)
- `scripts/bump-sw-version.cjs` — auto-bumps cache on `npm version`
- `scripts/inject-sw-assets.cjs` — injects hashed JS/CSS paths post-build
- "Update available" banner when new SW ready
- `npm run build` = tests + vite build + sw asset injection

### Tests
- **76 total**: 34 game logic + import checker + 20 travel + 22 alien
- All test loaders updated with multiline export stripping

---

## [0.23.0] — Reputation, Services, Travel Refactor

### Architecture
- TravelScreen refactor: logic → `engine/travel.js` (360 → 138 lines)
- `npm run build` runs tests first
- 54 checks before this release

### Reputation system (complete)
- Passive recovery every 10 days (blocked for murderers)
- Clean police inspections: accumulating probability N×15%
- Shadow Broker: |rep|×2000 cr → rep +3, scrubs 1 kill
- Legal fees blocked for murderers
- Government contracts expunge kills ("our killer")
- Pirate contracts (rep ≤ −4): 3 job types

### Service restrictions
- Strict govs (Communist/Confed/Democracy/Corp.State) ban at rep ≤ −3
- Repair always available at 3× price
- Banned port: sell = dump (free); crisis goods always sellable
- Crisis delivery bonus: rep +1

### Economy
- Duplicate weapons/shields allowed
- Moon: net worth = credits + cargo + ship − debt ≥ 500k; cash required to buy
- Illegal goods: always rep −1; bust chance based on police + rep

---

## [0.3.0-pre / 0.22.x] — Earlier changes
See git history.


### Architecture
- **TravelScreen refactor** — all business logic moved to `src/engine/travel.js`; TravelScreen is now rendering + handlers only (360 → 138 lines)
- `engine/travel.js` exports `getTravelState`, `applyTravel`, `applyPatrol`, `buildNews`
- **test-travel.cjs** — 20 travel engine tests: fuel cost, day increment, market init, shield recharge, debt interest, merc wages, news building, bulletin board, rep recovery, patrol encounters
- **`npm run build` runs tests first** — `npm test && vite build`; broken test blocks deploy
- Total test coverage: 34 game logic + import checker + 20 travel = **54 checks**
- Version bumped to 0.23.0

### Reputation system (complete)
- **Passive recovery** — +1 every 10 days toward 0; blocked for murderers (killedCivilian/killedPolice > 0)
- **Clean police inspections** — accumulating probability (N × 15%, max 60%); counter resets on gain; only toward 0
- **Shadow Broker** — random space encounter, |rep| × 2000 cr → rep +3, also scrubs 1 kill from record
- **Legal fees** (Bank) — 5000 × |rep+2| cr → rep +1; blocked entirely when player has kills
- **Surrender to police** — fine × 800 + jail days (+5/kill for murderers); rep → −1 (or −3 with kills); reduces kill count by 1
- **Government contracts** — extermination completion expunges 1 kill; assassination expunges 2 kills ("our killer")
- **Pirate contracts** (rep ≤ −4) — three types: patrol elimination, freighter attack, diplomat assassination; accepting costs rep −1; completion adds credits + optional equipment

### Service restrictions
- **Strict governments** (Communist, Confed, Democracy, Corp. State) ban services at rep ≤ −3
- War event on planet lifts all restrictions
- **Repair allowed at 3× price** — "they won't let you die, but won't make it easy"
- **Trade: sell → DUMP** — banned port refuses purchase; cargo dumped for free to clear space
- **Crisis goods** (medicine/food/water during plague/drought/war) always sellable even at banned port
- **Crisis delivery bonus** — arriving with crisis goods during matching event → rep +1

### Pirate contracts (criminal path)
- Three job types scale with rep severity: patrol elimination (−4), freighter (−6), diplomat/Flea (−8)
- Accepting costs rep −1 immediately; deadline 6–12 days
- Rewards: credits + optional equipment (Military Laser, Beam Laser, Energy Shield)
- Completion tracked via `onPirateJobKill` — fires when killing civilian or police in target system

### Combat & encounters
- **Kill counters** in StatusBar: ⚔ pirates / 💀 civilians / 🚔 police (shown only if > 0)
- **ATTACK on traders** — always available; starts real combat (merchant has Pulse Laser, no shields); win → killedCivilian++, rep −2, loot cargo
- **Police kills** → killedPolice++, rep −3, policeRecord +2; triggers wave escalation
- **Pirate waves scale with rep**: rep −4..−6: +1 wave; rep −7..−10: +2 waves, each harder
- **Police waves scale with killedPolice**: 1 kill → 1–2 cops; 3+ kills → 2–4, military tier
- **SURRENDER removed from pirate combat** — only available vs police

### Economy & trading
- **Duplicate weapons/shields** allowed (removed uniqueness filter)
- **Illegal goods** — always rep −1; bust chance = police × 10% + |rep| × 5%; bust = confiscation + fine × 1.5 + rep −2 total
- **Moon purchase** — net worth = credits + cargo value + ship value − debt ≥ 500,000; shows breakdown; cash ≥ 500k required to buy

### Bank
- **Separate sliders** for Borrow (0..maxBorrow) and Repay (0..min(debt,credits))
- **REPAY ALL** button
- **Legal fees** section replaces PAY FINE — expensive, blocked for murderers

### Mercenaries

- Planet-based availability restored after refactor

### Fuel Compressor
- Moved from gadget slot → `specialItems` (doesn't occupy equipment slot)
- Shown in SHIP → STATUS → Special Items as `⛽ Fuel Compressor · Jump range +3 pc`
- Transfer preserved across ship purchases

### UI/UX
- **Repair always visible** at tech < 2 — disabled with hint; at banned port — 3× price

### Architecture
- **Modular refactor** — monolithic App.jsx (4100 lines) split into 32 files:
  - `constants/` — ships, commodities, world data, events, mercenaries
  - `engine/` — pure functions: galaxy, market, combat, contracts, quests, utils
  - `hooks/` — useGameState (localStorage), useCombat (fight/flee/surrender)

### Combat
